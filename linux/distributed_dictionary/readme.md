1. What have I done in this assignment:
    I have finished all the requirement as described in the Project requirement. 
    - In Phase1A, all four servers will up and run. And the client will get the function and input from command line and send them to the AWS server over TCP connection. 
    - In Phase1B, the AWS server will send the function and input to the 3 back-servers using UDP connection. Each back-server will perform their respective database operation and then return their result to the AWS server using UDP.
    - In Phase2, the AWS server should combine the results collected from the 3 back-servers and send the results to both client and monitor.
2. what each file does:
    - serverA.cc: After it get data from AWS using UDP, it will perform its respective database operation and then send back the result to AWS.
    - serverB.cc: After it get data from AWS using UDP, it will perform its respective database operation and then send back the result to AWS.
    - serverC.cc: After it get data from AWS using UDP, it will perform its respective database operation and then send back the result to AWS.
    - aws.cc: it will get the function and input from client and then send them to 3 back-servers. After getting result from 3 back-servers, it will combine the results and send the final result to client and monitor.
    - client.cc: it will get the function and input from command line and send to AWS server using TCP connection. After processing, it will get the result and show on the screem.
    - monitor.cc: After processing, it will get the result from the AWS server and show on the screem.
3. how to run the programs:
    1. Frist you should open six different terminals. And using one of them to type `make all` to compile all the file.
    2. typing `./bin/serverA.out` using one terminal to run serverA.
    3. typing `./bin/serverB.out` using one terminal to run serverB.
    4. typing `./bin/serverC.out` using one terminal to run serverC.
    5. typing `./bin/aws.out` using one terminal to run AWS server.
    6. typing `./bin/monitor.out` using one terminal to run monitor.
    7. typing `./bin/client.out <function> <input>` using one terminal to run client. the <function> must be one of 'search' and 'prefix' and the <input> must be a word consisting of 27 characters or less.
4. The format of all the messages exchanged:
    - ./bin/client.out prefix Sea:
    The client is up and running.
    The client sent <Sea> and <prefix> to AWS.
    Found <36> match(es) for <Sea>:
    <Seam>

    - ./bin/aws.out:
    The AWS is up and running.
    The AWS received input=<Sea> and function=<prefix> from the client using TCP over port <25146>.
    The AWS sent <Sea> and <prefix> to Backend-Server A.
    The AWS received <12> match(es) from Backend-Server <A> using UDP over port <21146>.
    The AWS sent <Sea> and <prefix> to Backend-Server B.
    The AWS received <14> match(es) from Backend-Server <B> using UDP over port <22146>.
    The AWS sent <Sea> and <prefix> to Backend-Server C.
    The AWS received <10> match(es) from Backend-Server <C> using UDP over port <23146>.
    The AWS sent <36> matches to client.
    The AWS sent <36> matches to the monitor via TCP port 26146.
    - ./bin/serverA.out:
    The ServerA is up and running using UDP on port<21146>.
    The ServerA received input <Sea> and operation <prefix>.
    The ServerA has found <12> matches.
    The ServerA finished sending the output to AWS.
    - ./bin/serverB.out:
    The ServerB is up and running using UDP on port <22146>.
    The ServerB received input <Sea> and operation <prefix>.
    The ServerB has found <14> matches.
    The ServerB finished sending the output to AWS.
    - ./bin/serverC.out:
    The ServerC is up and running using UDP on port <23146>.
    The ServerC received input <Sea> and operation <prefix>.
    The ServerC has found <10> matches.
    The ServerC finished sending the output to AWS.
    - ./bin/monitor.out:
    The monitor is up and running.
    Found <36> match(es):
    <Seam>
    <Sea fern>

5. the idiosyncrasy:
    Under my test case, I have net found any fail. However, to run the project, you must obey the order described in "how to run" part.
6. Reused Code:
    There is no any reused code from anywhere in the program.
